## [](#header-2)Travel Cost
Vast distances involved would require subsidised travel. The soccer association that governs the soccer pryamid would subsidise costs. Only a professional soccer could afford to travel across the US for a soccer match. Take for example LA based club playing a match against a New York based club. Need to factor this in as a cost to each club.
