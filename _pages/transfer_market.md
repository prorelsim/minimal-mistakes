## [](#header-2)Transfer Market
An active transfer market both internally within the US and externally with other clubs around the world. Clubs enter into negotiations with other clubs. If a transfer fee is agreed then they agree a contract with the player directly. 

Players would move to another club if...
- they can offer them a higher salary
- they can offer them a longer length contract
- they play in a more competitive league 
- they play in continetal competitions
- their chance of playing for the US national team would increase
