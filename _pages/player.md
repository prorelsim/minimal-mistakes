## [](#header-2)Player
### [](#header-3)Player Contracts
In a promotion & relegation system, a player's contract is very important. As the biggest financial cost a club will have, other than player transfer fee, it can literally make or break a club.

Players will obviously try to get the best contracts they can. Clubs on the other hand should only offer contracts that make financial sense. In the event of relegation an affordable player contract can quickly become a huge financial burden that can seriously affect a clubs solvency. 
Contract clauses that reduce the player's salary in the event of relegation are evidence of prudent financial planning. 

But market forces dictate that clubs will try to get every advantage they can to try to achieve promotion, win trophies, generate more income or avoid relegation. So if a player says they have been offered a contract that guarantees them their full salary even in the event of relegation, a club will either have to pass on signing that player or commit to a contract that could put it in financial difficulty. This might be an easy decision if only one or two players ask for this but if every player demands this then the best players will move to clubs who agree to guarantee full salary in the event of relegation. And clubs who don't will be financial sound but field uncompetitive teams. Leading to the higher chance of relegation and with it decreased income and decreased standing. 

It's important to note that this is not because of the existence of promotion & relegation. The clubs and players are not entirely free to do as they choose. The Soccer Association which governs the leagues could impose rules on both players and clubs on what type of contracts can be signed. 

Case in point, the Bosman Ruling, which overnight changed football by tying a players registration with a club to his contract with that club. Once the players contract expired so did the clubs exclusive rights over the players registration. It is unimaginable now to think that once, when a players contract expired, he was still tied to that club who could just refuse to release his registration and in effect retire him as a player.
