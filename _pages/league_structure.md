## [](#header-2)League structure
### [](#header-3)Overview
*   semi-pro and amateur leagues organised on a regional basis.
*   one or more state wide professional leagues
*   one or more nation wide professional leagues

### [](#header-3)Pyramid Structure Design
The USA has a population of over 350 million. It has over 1000 cities. The population between states differs greatly. California has close to 40 million people where as Minnesota has a population of 5 million. It is easy to see a correlation between European countries and US states. California would be very similar to Spain, while Minnesota would be similar to Finland. Spain has a deep pyramid structure with professional clubs to be found as far down as division 4. Where as Finland has a shallow pyramid structure with only 2 professional leagues. 

### [](#header-3)Including Current Structure 
The MLS would be the national division one, the NASL, national division two. After that everything would be reorganised. With newly formed clubs being offered a position in each division based on supporter fanbase. Maybe a playoff to decide between two teams who are closely matched.
Only worry is that because this is division three, clubs may feel aggrieved that they are not starting higher in the pyramid. But I guess they will be ok with it because they can prove everyone wrong over the next two seasons. Maybe all clubs get an equal share of league income/prize money for the first four years to smooth things over as the promotion & relegation system settles itself.
