## [](#header-2)Travel Distance
The impact on a players performance to fly say 5 hours from LA to New York would need to be taken into account. It would not make sense for amateur or semi professional clubs to travel such distance. As such they would be organised into regional leagues. For professional leagues perhaps the fixture list could take into account distances and schedule long distance matches only after a certain number of short distance matches. But the nature of promotion & relegation is that the clubs in a league is determined by strength of team they can field. For example you could have a situation where half the clubs in the league are from the west coast while the other half are from the east coast.
