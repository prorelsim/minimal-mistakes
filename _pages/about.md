### [](#header-3)What Is ProRelSim?
ProRelSim stands for Promotion_and Relegation Simulation. This project aims to create a statistical model of a US soccer promotion & relegation pyramid structure. Showing how it would look and what effects it may have clubs.

### [](#header-3)What Is Promotion & Relegation?
*Promotion and relegation is a process where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance for the completed season. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are promoted to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are relegated to the lower division for the next season.* [read more here...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation)

### [](#header-3)Why?
There is now a growing interest in soccer at grassroots level in the US. Several amateur soccer clubs have already been setup and are being run successfully. In a promotion & relegation system, an amateur soccer club, could in theory, enter the lowest league in the soccer pryamid, gain promotion each season and eventually reach the top league in the country. It could then compete in continetal cups similar to the Champions League/UEFA Europa League in Europe and the Copa Liberatores in South America. The US is one of only three countries in the world that don't use promotion & relegation. Canada and Australia being the other two. Under the current system, a soccer club would need to be invited to play in the top league.
