### [](#header-3)Assumptions
*   that soccer can be the number one sport in the US.
*   that soccer could compete with other sports for talented athletes.
*   there are sponsors who wish to be involved in soccer
*   that many investors would get involved if there was a realistic chance a club they setup/invested in could get promoted to the top league
*   that many more people would start to go to matches if there were many clubs being formed around country. A kind of "who is your local club?". If people could drive 30mins to watch football at a decent stadium with a good experience.
*  groups of individuals who have followed soccer in the US and the world join together to form clubs. The excitement of seeing a club you created climb the leagues until it is playing against the best teams in the country.
