## [](#header-2)Bankruptcy/Insolvency
This is a reality of promotion & relegation systems and will be included. It will be assumed that this is down to mismanaged club resources and irresponsible management. Rather than the existence of relegation itself. Effects of relegation will be inverse to promotions. Income from ticket sales, TV coverage and merchandise will decrease as less people will want to watch lower calibre opposition or wish to travel to lower standard away stadiums. Players will seek transfers to play at higher leagues there by weakening the team the club can field. Some players may refuse to be transfered and this will affect the clubs finances as it will not be able to reduce its salary bill to match the income it recives from being in a lower league.
