## [](#header-2)How you can help?

If you have information on national, state or local level soccer in the US, please get in touch. The simulation will be continually refined and updated to make it as accurate as possible.
Here are the types of data needed...

*   salary data (players, staff etc)
*   stadium costs
*   taxes at state and federal level
*   travel costs
*   cost of loans
*   funding types available to US soccer clubs
*   stadiums that are available for hire/sale to owners
*   clubs that release their financial accounts
*   anything else you think should be included

Will have a credits page on the project to acknowledge people's contributions
